My wife recently underwent major surgey and needed my care in recovery, add this to two young children, a puppy and recent travel demands at work and you are often short on time. The good news is that now I feel like there is some stabilty returning to my life which has allowed me to <q> catch up </q> on Udacity work!</p> </div>
